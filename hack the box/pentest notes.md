## 1️⃣ code review
- downloading the zip file, we can see an java project, so the first file we may see is the ```pom.xml```, because he's like the AndroidManifest. after this, we take the package name and start the review of code properly
- in ```NotesController.java```, an sqli shines for us

- vulnerable line:
  ```java
  String query = String.format("Select * from notes where name ='%s' ", name);
  ```

## 2️⃣ exploiting sqli
- so all we have to do is go to /api/note and validate the sqli
